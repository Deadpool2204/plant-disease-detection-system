# Plant-Disease-Detection-System-for-Sustainable-Agriculture-new
It can detect disease happens to the plant with help of pictures of that plants leaf 

to execute this code first install the required libraries:
1]to train dataset code :
numpy
pickle-mixin
seaborn
pandas
matplotlib
scikit_learn
tensorflow
keras
opencv_python_headless

2] to ui code:
streamlit 
tensorflow 
numpy 
from PIL import Image
matplotlib.pplot 
folium
from streamlit_folium import folium_static
from fpdf import FPDF
time

after all library downloadation:
use open code name: Train_plant_disease-checkpoint_final.ipynb to train the dataset
note:jupyter notebook must be installed

after training og the dataset using **streamlit run app.py** command we can run the **app.py **
code for ui
